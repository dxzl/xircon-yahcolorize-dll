1) Colorize.tcl is a Tcl-language script you load into your
XiRCON chat-client. The script loads Colorize.DLL.

!!!!IMPORTANT at the beginning of the script you need make
sure you are loading Colorize.dll from the proper path. On
64-bit machines Colorize.dll will be in "Program Files (x86)"
not "Program Files"!!!!

2) Colorize.bpr is the Borland C++ Builder 4 project-file

3) Colorize.def is the DLL import-definitions file

4) YahCoLoRiZe also loads Colorize.DLL and talks with
XiRCON through the DLL to pass text to YahCoLoRiZe for
adding text effects and then sending the text back to
XiRCON to play into an IRC chat room.
